## Real-life end-to-end Data Science project using CRISP-DM methodology

> A real-life end-to-end data science project, including project planning, data analysis, data preprocessing, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, developing a web app, and deploying.


## Project Structure

> ðŸ›  Production-grade project structure for successful data-science and machine-learning projects ðŸš€

----------

Getting started
===============

This is where you describe how to get set up on a clean install, including the
commands necessary to get the raw data (using the `sync_data_from_s3` command,
for example), and then how to make the cleaned, final data sets.

## Commands

The Makefile contains the central entry points for common tasks related to this project.

### Syncing data to cloud storage

* `make sync_data_up` will use `aws s3 sync` to recursively sync files in `data/` up to `s3://analytics101/data/`.
* `make sync_data_down` will use `aws s3 sync` to recursively sync files from `s3://analytics101/data/` to `data/`.
